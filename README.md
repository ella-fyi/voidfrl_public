# voidfrl

this repository contains design and manufacturing files for my voidfrl through hole keyboard  

firmware not included as I lost my files and don't have time/willingness to do it again  

to view the design files, you can upload the .PcbDoc and .SchDoc files to [altium.com/viewer](https://www.altium.com/viewer/)  
if you want help with creating firmware and/or flashing the atmega32a controller with the usbasploader bootloader, I recommend the [QMK discord server](https://discord.com/invite/fBGYurv)
